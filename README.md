Text Classification Project using NLTK and Scikit-Learn

This project focuses on text categorization using natural language processing techniques. The workflow includes essential text preprocessing steps such as cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization, all performed using the NLTK package. The goal is to achieve a classification accuracy of at least 85%. For the classification task, popular classifiers from the scikit-learn package are employed.
